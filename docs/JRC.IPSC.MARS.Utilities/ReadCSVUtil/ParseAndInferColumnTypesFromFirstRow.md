# ReadCSVUtil.ParseAndInferColumnTypesFromFirstRow method

Parses the text stram and puts the contents into a DataTable. The Type of the columns are defined on the basis of the content of the first row of data. The user has to provide a list of Types to check for. Column by column, the content of the first row is analyzed to find one of the Types. If the content of a cell is of one of the Types, the column type is set to that Type, and each value of the column is transformed to that Type. If there is an error in the transformation for that row the value will not be converted. All not converted values will remain of type String. If more than a Type is suitable to be used as column type, the first in the array of Types is used.

```csharp
public static DataTable ParseAndInferColumnTypesFromFirstRow(TextReader stream, bool headers, 
    Dictionary<Type, IFormatProvider> typesToCheckFor, CultureInfo cultureInfo)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |

| headers | True if there is an header in the first row |
| typesToCheckFor | The sequence of Types to check for (keys of the Dictionary), and the (eventual) IFormatProvider (values of the Dictionary) |
