# ClassCopier class

This class can be used to copy valueType(s) (properties or fields) from a source object to a target object, regardless of each one's type, as long as the fields (properties) to be copied have the same name and are public. This works even if we copy a field to a property or viceversa. The copy can be fail-fast (meaning it immediately throw Exception if something goes wrong with a field copy) or not, ignoring the simple copy that goes wrong and tracing the problem into a log. They can be also configured to copy only a list of fields (properties) with specified names. Finally, if the types of the source field (property) and target field (property) are different, a conversion between the two types is searched in the IValueConverters registered with the ValueConverterRegistry singleton. The IValueConverter can be registered both for convert or reverseConvert directions (i.e.: if we need a conversion from string to int, also a converter from int to string will do), because the suitable conversion is searched in both directions.
