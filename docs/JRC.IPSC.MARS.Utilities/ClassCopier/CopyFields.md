# ClassCopier.CopyFields method (1 of 4)

Copies fields/properties' values from the source to the target object. By default, all public fields/properties in the source are copied into the target object and an Exception raised during a single field/property copy is ignored.

```csharp
public void CopyFields(object source, object target)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| source | The source object. |
| target | The target object. |

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | If a property/field with the name of the one to be copied from the source is not found in the target object. |

# ClassCopier.CopyFields method (2 of 4)

Copies fields/properties' values from the source to the target object. By default, all public fields/properties in the source are copied into the target object.

```csharp
public void CopyFields(object source, object target, bool ignoreExceptionInCopyingOneField)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| source | The source object. |
| target | The target object. |
| ignoreExceptionInCopyingOneField | If true, an error in copying one field/property is ignored leaving the corresponding field/property in the target object set to its default value. If false, in case of problems during the copy of one field/property an ArgumentException is immediately raised. |

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | If a property/field with the name of the one to be copied from the source is not found in the target object, or if there's a more generic problem with the copy of a single field/property (if ignoreExceptionInCopyingOneField == true), for example if the types source and target field/property types are different and a suitable IValueConverter is not found in the ValueConverterRegistry singleton. |
